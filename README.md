# CMUStore
This is my first real attempt at a big project. It actually has a large amount of functionality. It can pretty much do everything inteded, but it just doesn't have a front end. It has a RESTful API with routers for two types in the MongoDB database (Items and Users). For users, have implemented user creation, login (JWT), logout (JWT), user account deletion, and user email verification. For items, I have implemented item creation, item image uploads via multer to AWS S3 buckets, item paginated viewing, an elementary search functionality, an item value change route given the user is admin (with verification), and an item delete (with verification). It also has a nice error handler that returns actual HTTP response codes. There's also an email sending system with nodemailer. Overall I'm pretty proud of it and I learned a lot even though it isn't part of a larger project.
